    <p> Hello Supply team, </p> </br>
    <p> I just noticed that there are reference numbers who are shipped in FEX in their daily report but when I compared it against the list of shipped order numbers in Skubana on that day based on their tracking numbers it was not found. </p>
    <p> I also tried searching orders that are PENDING_FULFILLMENT in Skubana with similar order numbers to automatically update it but I can't find it.</p>
    </br>
    <p> These are the order numbers in FEX for your review: </p> </br>
    <ul>
      <? for (var i = 0; i < data.length; i++) { ?>
        <li><?= data[i]["orderNumber"] ?> - <?= data[i]["trackingNumber"] ?></li>
      <? } ?>
    </ul>
    Thank you.
